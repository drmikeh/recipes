# Rib Roast

Cook the prime rib sous vide for between 5 and 10 hours. I now almost exclusively cook mine at 131°F (55°C) for a nice medium-rare. I wouldn't go above 137°F (58.3° C) unless everyone at the table like it at least medium. And remember not to go much below 130°F (54.4°C) for more than a few hours as per the sous vide safety guidelines.

As I said, I used a prime rib roast from grass fed beef which tenderizes faster so I cooked mine for about 6 hours and it was perfect but if you're using a supermarket top round or chuck roast you might want to try for up to 10 hours.

Just before the sous vide prime rib is done pre-heat the oven to around 400 or 450 and then make the paste or rub that you will use for the crust. I roasted fresh garlic, rosemary, thyme, and olive oil and mashed it into a paste. You can make any kind of paste or rub you prefer, there are lots of different variations on seasoning prime rib that you can adapt to this method.

When the sous vide prime rib roast is done, take it out of the pouch and pat it dry. Then place the prime rib on a sheet pan or roasting tray that can go into the oven. Smear the paste or rub on the outside of the meat that is exposed and place the roast in the oven. You just want to leave it in there long enough to develop the crust but not cook the roast any more.

Once the crust is done you take the sous vide prime rib out of the oven, slice it and serve it. I served mine with roasted turnips but they are great with any normal roast side dish such as mashed potatoes, sauteed kale, mixed vegetables, a side salad, or polenta.

## Cooking Instructions for Sous Vide Prime Rib

### For the Pre-Bath
1. Pre-heat the water bath to 131°F (55°C).
2. Cover the prime rib roast with salt, pepper, the garlic, and ancho chile powders and place in a pouch.
3. Add the thyme and rosemary to the sous vide pouch and then seal the roast.

At this point you can store the pouch in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, freeze it for up to 6 months, or cook it right away.

### For the Sous Vide Prime Rib
1. At least 6 to 11 hours before serving
2. Place the prime rib roast in the water bath and cook for 5 to 10 hours depending on the tenderness of the prime rib roast you are using. For a grass-fed sirloin roast 5 hours should be good up to 10 hours for a supermarket prime rib.
