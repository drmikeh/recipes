# The Best Scrambled eggs

The method I always use, and is Gordon Ramsaysâ€™ is simplest and never fails.

* Cold pan.
* Large lump of butter.
* Break three eggs into it.
* Season with salt and white pepper.
* Turn on heat.
* Stir as the butter melts, and keep stirring.
* As the egg starts to set up into curds, keep taking the pan off the heat so it doesn't overcook.
* Keep stirring.

At the point where its almost done, take pan off heat and add a tablespoon of cold creme fraiche.

Done.
