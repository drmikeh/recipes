1. Broccoli

    a. Turn the heat to medium and removes the vegetables
    b. Add the remaining oil to the pan, then the remaining garlic and ginger
    c. Stir, then add the chicken
    d. Raise the heat to high, stir the chicken once, then let it sit for 1 minute before stirring again.
    e. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken has lost its pinkness, 3 to 5 minutes

4. Chicken and Veggies
    a. Return the veggies to the pan and toss once or twice
    b. Add the sugar, if desired, and the soy sauce, and toss again
