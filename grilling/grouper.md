## Notes

* Grilling grouper in aluminum foil is easy to make and easy to clean up.
* This simple grilled grouper recipe takes 10 to 12 minutes from grill to plate.
* A sprinkle of Italian herbs and a little olive oil and fresh lemon juice is drizzled over the fresh grouper.
* The fish is steamed in a foil pouch in its own juices and delivers great flavor.
* I used an Italian seasoning, a mix of dried fennel seed, basil, red pepper, garlic and parsley. It's delicious sprinkled on fresh grouper.
* This grouper with lemon and herbs is light and delicious and pairs beautifully with my Orzo and Summer Roasted Vegetables and a crisp Sauvignon Blanc.
